# GBN-SAW-protocol--Error-Control
Error control in GBN and SAW protocols

To simulate the packet loss, we will use pseudo random number to control that.
First program will ask the user to input a number between [0, 99]. This number means the percentage of packet losses will happen in the transmission.
Then each time before you send your protocol data unit, your program will generate a pseudo random number in the range [0, 99] with the random seed set to the current system time. If the random number generated is less than the user input number, then the current protocol data unit wonâ€™t be sent to simulate a packet loss.
It also calculates time taken to transmit the data , number of packets sent .Also the number of packets resent due to packet loss.
For SAW protocol the field "Seq_Num_Mod" in packet class should be modified to 2.
